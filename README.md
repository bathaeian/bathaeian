- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Narges
- I've taught principals of compilers and programming languages for many years.
- What you can find in this Git:
-  A number of repositories that I used as materials in my classes. They are very simple and useful for learning.  
-  A few repositories for my research purposes.
