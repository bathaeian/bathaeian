- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Narges
- I've taught principals of compilers and programming languages for many years.
- What you can find in this Git:
   1. A number of repositories that I used as materials in my classes. They are very simple and useful for learning.  </LI>
   2. A few repositories for my research purposes.</LI>
